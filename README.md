# Project Description:

This is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app that works in your web browser. It allows multiple users to draw, write, and share ideas together at the same time. Just like using a real whiteboard, people can sketch shapes, add text, and move things around — but online, from anywhere. It’s great for teamwork, brainstorming, teaching, or planning projects with others.
